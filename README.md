To run the `.ipynb` notebooks in VSCode, try installing [The Jupyter Notebook Extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-toolsai.jupyter). When you try to run a cell in the notebook, you should get prompted to select which Python environment you want to install.

To run build123d files, whether as a `.ipynb` notebook or a `.py` script, run the following on in the integrated terminal in VSCode:

```console
python -m pip install build123d ocp_vscode


```
